      <abstract>The stratigraphic horizon grids were generated by picking formation tops in 16,200 borehole geophysical logs and interpolating between them in the Williston Basin of North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana. Collectively, the horizon grids outline the structural framework of the Williston Basin from the ground surface to the crystalline basement. The grids define the boundary surfaces between geologic layers in the 3D petroleum systems model. Not every horizon in the petroleum systems model, however, ties to a specific interpreted set of formation tops (see the ‘Williston_Basin_data_overview.csv’ table to see which horizons were derived from interpreted formation tops). Some horizons were split/calculated to accommodate source rock intervals or net evaporite thicknesses (denoted halite or anhydrite in the file name suffix). Although some lithostratigraphic units are not present throughout the entire area of interest (AOI), the petroleum systems model requires that each grid cover the entire AOI. Another requirement for the petroleum systems model is that each horizon grid be assigned a geologic age. This is a child item of a larger data release titled "Data release for the 3D petroleum systems model of the Williston Basin, USA".</abstract>
      <purpose>The stratigraphic horizon grids are a required input for running the 3D petroleum systems model. They provide constraints on burial history, and they serve as the bounding framework for defining distinct lithologic packages. These data are also useful for visualizing the regional-scale (basin-scale) subsurface stratigraphic and structural architecture. Collectively, these horizons represent a 3D model of the subsurface, and modeling steps were taken to ensure that horizons do not intersect or cross one another.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>There are 47 horizon grids. The file naming convention uses the prefix “HRZ” to indicate horizon, the three-digit numerical code represents the geologic age assignment used in the model (millions of years ago, Ma), and the lithostratigraphic unit name assigned to the horizon comes after the underscore. See the “Williston_Basin_data_overview.csv” data table and accompanying metadata for more details on file naming convention. All grids are in a conventional depth orientation for petroleum systems modeling, where elevation values below the mean sea level reference datum are positive and values above the mean sea level reference datum are negative. Below is a list of all 47 horizon grids used in the model:

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>The stratigraphic horizons were generated by interpolating between formation tops picked on borehole geophysical logs. The interpolation method used in generating each horizon was done using Kingdom’s “Flex Gridding” algorithm and setting the data fit to preserve minimum curvature. Using this method, the highs and lows produced in the generated horizon may be projected higher and lower than the highest and lowest input formation top values. This processing step was used to generate a set of four “anchor” horizons: “HRZ097_Mowry.asc”, “HRZ330_Kibbey.asc”, “HRZ357_Bakken_upper.asc”, “HRZ445_RedRiver_uppermost.asc”.  These grids were selected as “anchors” due to high quality geophysical log markers, making formation top picking rapid and robust over a broad region and providing good constraints in the interpolation process.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>To ensure that each horizon does not cross or intersect with overlying and underlying horizons, we used a stacked isochore grid method where isochore grids were generated by interpolating the true vertical thickness (TVT) between formation tops and then subtracted and added in sequence from the ground surface horizon (“HRZ000_Topography.asc”) down to the basement (“HRZ542_Basement.asc”). This is an iterative process and the anchor horizons generated in the previous step provide the framework for building the additional horizon grids above and below.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Not all the horizon grids tie to a specific set of formation tops. Some horizons were split/calculated to accommodate source rock intervals or net evaporite thicknesses (denoted halite or anhydrite in the file name suffix).

        <procdesc>Each horizon is assigned a geologic age, which is identified using the numerical component of the file name prefix. An essential requirement in all 3D petroleum systems models is that the geographic extent of each stratigraphic horizon covers the entire area of interest (AOI). In some cases, the represented lithostratigraphic unit (e.g., the Bakken Formation) has a geographical extent that is smaller than the AOI and it is therefore necessary to assign the formation to a chronostratigraphic horizon that covers the entire AOI.</procdesc>
